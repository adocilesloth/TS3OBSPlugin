TS3OBSPlugin
============
Plugin that edits a TS3 nickname to have a defined prefix when streaming.
(Hopefully) Fixed the bug that renamed a user r or cted.

Compiled using VS 2013

INSTALLATION
============
Put TS3Plugin.dll into ../Program Files/OBS/plugins folder
or
Put TS3Plugin.dll into ../Program Files (x86)/OBS/64 bit/plugins folder
depending on installation and if you are using x64 or x32(x86) OS.
Before streaming, open the TS3 Recording Notifier config.
In the second box add your TS3 Unique ID (Settings -> Identities -> Unique ID)
Change \*R\* to what ever you want the prefix to be (must be 10 characters or less and have NO spaces)
